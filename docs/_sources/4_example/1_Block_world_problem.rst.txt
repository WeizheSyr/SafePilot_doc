We present the simulations for the Fast Attack Recovery for Stochastic Cyber-Physical Systems paper [4]_. 
We propose the solution to the Optimal probabilistic recovery (OPR). 
We use the linear model of a motor as an example. 
For the experiments in the paper, we simulate a bias attack against the motor angular speed measurement by adding a bias of -1m/s.
The adversary deploys the attack at time 3s after beginning the simulation, and the detector identifies the attack one second later.
This alarm triggers the recovery strategies.


We compare the performance of our solution, called the open loop OPR (OPR-OL), with the LQR-based recovery [2]_, and virtual sensors.
We then obtain the next Figure:

.. image:: images/4_fast_recovery/timeseries_motor_speed_3_strats.jpg
   :width: 650 px
   :align: center
   :alt: Attack Recovery Performance for Baselines for the motor system

We also include the simulations to improve our solution by incorporating the non-compromised sensors into the recovery. 
We call this strategy the partially closed loop OPR (OPR-PCL).
We compare the OPR-OL and OPR-PCL:

.. image:: images/4_fast_recovery/timeseries_motor_speed_opr.jpg
   :width: 650 px
   :align: center
   :alt: Attack Recovery Performance for Baselines for the motor system

We provide the code to obtain previous figures.

    :caption: Bias attack on the CSTR benchmark

An user can change the attack characteristics (e.g., detection delay).
