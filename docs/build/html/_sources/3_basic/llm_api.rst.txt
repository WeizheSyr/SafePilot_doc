LLM API
~~~~~~~

This component is implemented by the Llm class, primarily responsible for interacting with the LLM. 
The component calls the LLM via function calling (by default using GPT's function calling API). It interacts with the LLM in a conversational manner, enabling the LLM to retain memory of previous dialogues.
