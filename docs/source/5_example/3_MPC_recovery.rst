Numerical Simulators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. First, we aim to evaluate the recovery performance of different baseline recovery controllers. We only require modifying the configuration file rather than writing simulation code.
In this file, we choose a benchmark plant, CSTR shown in the following figure, controlled by a PID controller.
Also, we define the bias sensor attack that subtracts 25K from the temperature sensor feedback starting from the ninth second.
The detector identifies the attack at the 10th second, and triggers the recovery controllers.
Baseline recovery controllers include (i) no recovery method (none), (ii) software-sensor-based recovery (ssr [1]_), (iii) linear-quadratic-regulator-based recovery (lqr [2]_), and (vi) data-predictive recovery (mpc [3]_).

First, we aim to evaluate the recovery performance of different baseline recovery controllers. We only require modifying the configuration file rather than writing simulation code.
In this file, we use three benchmark plants, CSTR, quadrotor and Vessel, controlled by a PID controller.
Also, we define the bias sensor attack.
The detector identifies the attack after the attack happends and triggers the recovery controllers.
Baseline recovery controllers include (i) no recovery method (none), (ii) software-sensor-based recovery (ssr [1]_), (iii) linear-quadratic-regulator-based recovery (lqr [2]_), and (vi) data-predictive recovery (mpc [3]_).



The following figure plots the results from the simulator. From the curve, we can intuitively analyze the recovery performance of each baseline recovery controller.

We conduct a sensitivity analysis by varying bias values and noise on the CSTR benchmark. The findings are displayed in the two figures below.

We also provide the sensitivity analysis by the noise with varying upper bound on the quadrotor benchmark.
