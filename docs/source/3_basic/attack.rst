We consider three attack scenarios: bias, delay, and replay. A bias attack typically involves intentionally introducing systematic errors or biases into a system.
This type of attack is especially pertinent in systems relying on sensor data or algorithmic decision-making.
A delay attack focuses on manipulating the timeliness of information within CPSs. The attacker intentionally introduces delays in transmitting vital data or commands, thereby causing a disruption in the regular operation of the system.
A replay attack entails the capture of valid data transmissions, which are then retransmitted at a later time. The crucial element of this attack lies in the legitimacy of the data itself; however, it is reused or replayed at an unsuitable moment or in an incorrect context.
